##Reading and creating tidy datasets from 'Human Activity Recognition' data
###Short notice on the data source
Using the HAR data from UCI databases from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. We are going to use the following txt files to create our handy datasets:* 'activity_labels.txt' - contains the labels for the physical activities to be measured during the exercise.* 'features.txt' - contains a vector of the names of the different measurements (561 different features.)* './test/y_test.txt' - subject ids for the test data.* './test/X_test.txt' - feature values for the test data.* './train/y_train.txt' - subject ids for the training data.* './train/X_train.txt' - feature values for the training data.
